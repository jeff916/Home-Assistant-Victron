# **Victron Modbus Configuration**

Configuration for the Victron Energy components, MultiPlus, BMV-702, BlueSolar MPPT in Home Assistant.
Below are the Victron sensors implemented by the configuration files.

The Modbus configuration is defined with 2 files:
- The victron-modbus.yaml file contains the configuration for the Modbus regesters
- The VictronValueMapping.yaml file (located in the templates folder) maps numeric values to user friendly textual values. Like the solar charger on/off value of 1 or 4 to On or Off

Together these files implement the Victron Energy values Iâ€™m currently using in my HA setup. By using separate files I'm able to keep the main HA configuration file cleaner. You will see below that I am using the dir_merge_list capability so that I can have multiple "template" files to keep functionality separate as my HA capability is expanded.

To include these files you need to add the following to your configuration.yaml
```
# Modbus
modbus: !include victron-modbus.yaml
        
template: !include_dir_merge_list templates
```

The Modbus device address are defined as entries in the HA secret file. Create an entry for each Modbus device like: 
```
